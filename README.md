The project is a management system where you handle employees. 
The purpose of this project was to develope a system by using polymorphism which is used for the diffrent employee titles. 
The class Employee is abstract and the specific titles for the employee is in individual classes that inherit from the abstract class.
The individual diffrence between the classes that inherit from Employee is the bonus setting. 
It's not connected to a database so the information is just collected in a ArrayList.
The project gives the user posibility to get statistics from the system. In the code we are using streams to filter and sort in the list so the 
user gets the requested information.
